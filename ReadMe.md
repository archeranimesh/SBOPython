# Safari Book | Data Structures and Algorithms in Python #
## By: Michael H. Goldwasser, Roberto Tamassia, Michael T. Goodrich ##

I am following the [Safari Book's Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/data-structures-and/9781118290279/ "Safari Book's Data Structures and Algorithms in Python"), and will try to finish all the course under this track to increase my understanding of the python language. I am not aware of any copyright issues, but will upload in [my Github profile](https://github.com/archeranimesh/) for the version control on my study.

This is a notes taking repository which will have code and my understanding of the course. Kindly mail me if there an issue with copyright will try to remove it.

## Preface ##

The basic building block of Object Oriented programming is the idea of encapsulating the data with the method which access and modifies them. **Abstract Data Type** confirms on this view, where we encapsulate both data and the methods which operates on the data. **ADT** can be implemented in multiple ways with each way having a pros and cons. We have to weigh these pros and cons of a particular implementation before using a particular implementation.
